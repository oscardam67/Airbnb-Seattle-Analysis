## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project utilizes default packages within the Anaconda distribution of Python for the majority of the analysis. 

However, you will need to install scikit-learn if you haven't already done so before. See [Getting Started with scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html).

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data to analyze and understand:

1. Do the reviews impact listing price? Are only the property specifications relevant for pricing?

2. What is the distribution of prices in the neighborhoods of Seattle? What is the most expensive? What is the cheapest?

3. Is the price linearly related to the variables analyzed in question 2? Is it possible to predict the price by implementing a linear algorithm? How accurate is it?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to address the questions above.

The data is in the listings.csv file, which was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@oscardamb/i-want-an-extra-income-how-much-should-i-offer-my-property-in-airbnb-seattle-7b16c35898bd).
